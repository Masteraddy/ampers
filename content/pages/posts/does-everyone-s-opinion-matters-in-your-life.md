The truth is opinion actually matters. But what do you understand by the word **opinion.** With my little knowledge about it, I noticed it can build friendship, break friendship and even start a friendship. In short, it can make, mend and also destroy.

It's like a tool that work based on the hand it falls on. If it falls into hand of envy or jealousy, it will destroy if care is not taken.

This reminds me of the story of a friend. I heard a friend who was in relationship with a guy, and the guy always take care of her with every chances he gets. But my friend always misbehave because she was always listening to other people's advice in her relationship.

When she had little fight with her boyfriend, she'll always tell her friends and they'll advice her to break-up with him, but due to the love this guy had for her, they'll find their way round it and come back together.

To cut the long story short, unknown to her still unknown but known to me, the people advising her to break-up her the people going behind her to her boyfriend to make love to him or begging him to date them but he kept them rejected. And they taught if they break the relationship between the two lovers they'll have their chances.

This is only part that we see. Some might even advice you to the extent of your own death.

But when you see a good advice you'll surely know. Life someone telling you to settle a fight, or telling you to leave a toxic friendship or relationship. Those are good advice.

In the end all I could say is, there's always limitations to what people should access in your life. Don't give them too much you, unless they'll take control. And once you've lost control it might be too late before you get it back.
